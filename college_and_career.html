            <p>I am someone who thrives on challenges. I enroll in rigorous courses to ensure that I'm always pushing my
                limits. In the future, my aspiration is to become an aerospace engineer with a specialization in
                spacecraft.</p>

            <p>I attended kindergarten and stayed until the second grade of elementary at a private school in Mexico
                named Colegio Montessori Jean Itard. After that, I transferred to Price Elementary and completed my
                remaining
                years of elementary education there. Following my elementary years, I continued my education at Sycamore
                Jr.High and
                joined the DLA program. Throughout my years at Anaheim High School, I have taken a total of 9 AP classes
                including the ones I am currently enrolled in, and I am presently ranked in the top 1% of my class.
                Additionally, I am one of the eight Simon Scholars at our school.</p>

            <p>After completing my college applications, I'm filled with hope about the prospect of being accepted into
                my
                dream school, UCLA. I'm particularly drawn to this university because of the surrounding city, Westwood,
                aligns well
                with my lifestyle and preferences. My selected major is aerospace engineering. During my college years,
                I also plan
                to continue pursuing my passion for dance, whether that means joining a local studio or participating in
                a dance club on
                campus.</p>

            <p>My career goal is to become an aerospace engineer for NASA. I have wanted to pursue this career since I
