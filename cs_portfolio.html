    <div class="biography">
        <p>My name is Marisa Hernandez Villasenor, and I am 17 years old. I was born in</p>
            <p>the United States but moved to Baja California, Mexico, just months after my birth</p>
            <p>due to my grandma's health issues. In Mexico, I attended kindergarten and elementary</p>
            <p>until I was about six years old.</p>
            <P>When I started school in the United States, I faced significant challenges because of</P>
            <p>my inability to speak English fluently. Many of my new elementary school peers took</p>
            <p>advantage of my vulnerability and bullied me.</p>
            <p>But as soon as I became fluent in English, I seized all the academic opportunities</p>
            <p>that came my way, earning a reputation as an "overachiever." Determination and hard</p>
            <p>work have been my guiding principles, leading me to my current achievements. I excel</p>
            <p>in even the most challenging classes I undertake, maintaining perfect grades. I've also</p>
            <p>managed to balance my role as Dance Captain, essentially living in the dance studio,</p>
            <p>with my rigorous coursework.</p>
            <p>I used the adversity I faced as a powerful source of motivation to become the best</p>
            <p>version of myself. I dedicate all my time to my studies not only to satisfy my own</p>
            <p>aspirations but also to honor the sacrifices my parents made for us.</p>
